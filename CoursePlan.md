# Goal

You will be able, at the end of this course, to :

- find information.
- fit a curve. It can be useful.
- even fit a curve with associated errors !
- say that MCMC does not refer to something potentially harmful, except for your old laptop
- propagate errors.
- fit the diffusion of Al$^{3+}$ in olivine. or the CO2 versus time curve, or viscosity data. Or any geochemical data with a model (at least, find the necessary information to do so)

# Tools

- Python and a stack of good library, including numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.
- But the principles are the same whatever the language, so this can be easily transfered to Julia, R, Matlab, C, FORTRAN...

# Work case

We will focus on one working case: fitting a diffusion profile in olivine, to find the concentration at the rim and the diffusion coefficient of the diffusing element. We will generate synthetic data, and ultimately apply what we learn on real data.

# Timing

- First class : problem introduction, start with curve_fit
- Second class : more on objective functions and error propagation
- Last class : MCMC introduction, discussion

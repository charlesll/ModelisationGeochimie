# Goal

You will be able, at the end of this course, to :

- find information
- fit a curve. It can be useful.
- even fit a curve with associated errors !
- say that MCMC does not refer to something potentially harmful, except for your old laptop
- propagate errors
- fit the diffusion of Al$^{3+}$ in olivine. or the CO2 versus time curve. Or any geochemical data with a model (at least, find the necessary information to do so)

# Tools

- Python and a stack of good library, including numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.
- But the principles are the same whatever the language, so this can be easily transfered to Julia, R, Matlab, C, FORTRAN...

# Timing

- First four hours : we will see why, how, and how not to fit a curve.
- Last four hours : MCMC introduction, application to fit a curve, discussion

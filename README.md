# ModelisationGeochimie

Material for the course Modélisation en Géochimie

# Dependencies

You will need a working installation of Python, please see that with Google. I recommend Anaconda Python, that will provide a fully-featured Python distro with Jupyter Notebooks.

In term of libraries, we will need:
- matplotlib
- scipy
- numpy
- pandas
- emcee
- corner
- uncertainties

Install that on your computer with this command in the terminal (Linux/MacOS, search Google for Windows as I don't know this OS):

'pip install matplotlib scipy numpy pandas emcee corner uncertainties'

# Running on Binder

Alternatively, the notebooks can be run without installing anything on your computer on the website MyBinder at this address:

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/charlesll/ModelisationGeochimie/master

Please note that, for the first run, you will need to install all the packages. This can be done by adding this command at the very top of the first code cell:

'!pip install matplotlib scipy numpy pandas emcee corner uncertainties'
